## Use cases

### Mentions

Preconditions: 
- The user MUST be in a chat

*Primary Scenairo*
1. User types `@` in chat input box
2. System opens the @mention suggestions menu. Valid contacts are listed in alphabetical order
3. User types another character
4. System filters the suggestions so that only suggestions that match the characters the user has typed after the`@` symbol are displayed.  The results of this filtering are orded by the following criteria:
    1) Results that match the search in the beginning of the username
    2) Results that closely match the query
    3) Alphabetical
5. User sees that the person they wish to @mention is at the top of the suggestions menu (top menu item is always focused by default)
6. User presses ENTER to select the focused contact
7. System closes the suggestions menu and completes the @mention string in the text input box
USE CASE ENDS

*Variation 5a - User moves the focus in the menu*
1. User sees that the person they wish to @mention in the suggestions menu but that person is not focused 
2. User moves the focus in the suggestions menu using the up and down cursors to the person they wish to @mention (if needed)
RETURN TO 7

*Variation 5b - User abandons selecting somebody to @mention*
1. User decides that they don't want to @mention anybody 
2. User presses SPACE or ESC
3. System closes the suggestions menu and returns focus to the text entry box.
4. System places the text caret at the end of whatever the user has typed, including whatever the user typed while navigating and/or closing the suggestions menu.   
USE CASE ENDS

- Selecting text with the keyboard (shift + arrow keys) SHOULD display the formatting menu
- Selecting one of the options in the formatting menu MUST change the selected text to reflect the markdown that applies that style
